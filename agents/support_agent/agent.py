"""
Part 2b: Support Agent (15 points)

Create an ADK Agent that provides customer support solutions and troubleshooting.

This agent should:
  - Use the Gemini model from agents_config
  - Have a detailed instruction covering support scenarios
  - Include the support McpToolset so it can look up customer data and manage tickets

The McpToolset auto-discovers tools from the MCP server. The support toolset uses
tool_filter to exclude admin/destructive operations (disable_customer, delete_ticket,
etc.) so the support agent can only perform safe operations.

Requirements:
  - create_agent() returns a configured google.adk.agents.Agent (5 pts)
  - Agent has a comprehensive instruction with support knowledge base (5 pts)
  - Agent uses create_support_toolset() for data-driven support (5 pts)

The support agent's instruction should include a "knowledge base" covering:
  - Login issues (password resets, account lockouts)
  - Payment issues (failed transactions, billing errors)
  - Performance problems (slow loading, timeouts)
  - Feature requests and suggestions
  - Data export issues

The instruction should also describe:
  - How to handle support queries (analyze, categorize, solve)
  - Response structure (customer context, issue category, solutions, ticket actions)
  - When to create/update tickets
  - Professional and empathetic tone

    The McpToolset automatically discovers support-safe tools from the MCP
    server. Admin/destructive tools are excluded by the tool_filter.

            - Payment issues (failed transactions, billing errors)
            ...

            When handling support queries:
